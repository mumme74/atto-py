src# This is an plementation of the very simple functional language atto.
## Atto was created by Joshua Berretto (zesterer)
This project aims to re-create this very simple Language interpreter in python.

## The original atto language:
Mr Joshua Berretto, github user: zesterer, created this very simple language interpreter in rust to show what was possible to in a couple of hundred lines of rust code.  
That intepreter can be found at [https://github.com/zesterer/atto/] and will henceforth be namned the original implementation.

## Why create an interpreter in python?
The purpose of this project is mostly the learning process for me.
I am currently studying a course about code quality and programming principles given at Umeå university.

## The goal of this project
My goal with this project is to get this interpreter to work with all examples in the examples directory in the original project.
